# Asthma Disease Detection

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to accurately detect asthma disease using various classification algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Asthma Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/asthma-disease-dataset). It contains data relevant to asthma disease detection.

## Description
This project involves training and evaluating multiple machine learning models to detect asthma disease. The models' performance is compared using metrics such as accuracy and ROC AUC score. Confusion matrices are also plotted for each model to visualize the performance.

## What I Had Done
1. Loaded the asthma disease dataset from Kaggle.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Implemented multiple machine learning models.
4. Trained and evaluated each model.
5. Plotted confusion matrices for each model.
6. Saved the results (accuracy and ROC AUC) to a CSV file.
7. Generated a comparison plot of the models' performance.

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- AdaBoost
- Extra Trees
- Bagging
- CatBoost
- LightGBM
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Stacking Classifier

## Libraries Needed
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- catboost
- lightgbm
- mlxtend

## EDA Results
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed the following key points:
- Feature distributions and correlations
- Class imbalance in the dataset
- Identification of important features for asthma disease detection
